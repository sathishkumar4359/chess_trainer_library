square.} 4... d5 5. exd5 Nxd5 {This capture on d5 by the knight allows white a
very dangerous attack with a sacrifice.} 6. Nxf7 $1 {The true Fried Liver Attack
move $1} 6... Kxf7 7. Qf3+ {The queen comes out with a double attack against the
knight on d5 and the king.} 7... Ke6 {The only move if Black wants to save the
